<div class="vspace" style="height: 1em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>You have been so good to me, in purchasing,
within a few weeks, five hundred copies of a
feuilleton, only intended for private circulation,
I should like to show my appreciation, by
catering to your desire for information regarding our
dear old city, Quebec; but what can I do?
My learned friend, James Macpherson LeMoine,
Esq., with his wonderful knowledge of facts,
so exhausted the subject in his excellent
and beautifully got up book, "Picturesque
Quebec," I am utterly overwhelmed.
Until I began to study the matter I was quite
ignorant that he had written so fully on
these matters, so I can only play Boswell to
his Johnson, and as without Boswell many of
the sayings of the immortal Johnson would
have been lost, I too may have my use in
recording crumbs of information, interesting
and instructive, though lacking the dignity of
history.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>My first recollection is that of being drawn in
a child's carriage by old Germain, messenger of
the Quebec Bank (where I was born), to the old
convent, formerly occupying the site of McCall,
Shehyn &amp; Co.'s store at the foot of Mountain Hill
in St. Peter Street, Quebec.  This convent has
been non-existant for forty-seven years.  Its
community now reside in St. Joseph Street,
St. Roch's.  When this convent was there, there
was no St. Peter Street, there were no wharves,
and an old sister told me the batteau men
often struck their sails against their convent.  I
remember my father often called at the
convent to take me out boating on the St. Lawrence
River that lapped its shores, for the lower
town of Quebec was then a delightful residence
for Quebec people, only the military then
residing in the Upper Town.  Applying for information
about this old convent to Ville Marie, the
Mother House of this order, I received the
following letter from one of the ladies:</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>As I am obliged to absent myself, I have
only time to give the year of the present
foundation at Quebec.  The first house was in the
Upper Town, established in 1688 under the
direction of the venerable Mother Bourgeois.
This house was transferred to the Lower Town
in 1692, under Mons. de St. Vallière, and in
1844 the convent of the Lower Town not
being any more convenient, the sisters went
and fixed themselves in St. Roch's under
Monseigneur Signai and the Rev. Curé Mr. Charest.
Rev. Mère St. Madeleine was Superioress
of the Congregation of Notre Dame.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I have just returned from a very pleasant
visit (my first) to Villa Maria, the Maison Mère
of the old Convent of the Congregation,
forty-seven years ago at the foot of Mountain Hill,
Quebec.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Taking the St. Catherine street cars as far as
the Post-Office, at the toll-gate you enter an
omnibus (at certain hours) which takes you, for
the moderate sum of five cents, to the gate
leading into the grounds of Villa Maria, the
first educational establishment of the
Congregation de Nôtre Dame, formerly Moncklands.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The approach on the Côte St. Antoine Road
is beautiful, especially at this season, when the
trees surrounding the various pretty homes to
some of our Montreal gentry are just taking on
their autumn tints.  At one residence especially
I noticed the leaves of every color, from varied
green and red, pale pink, and deep crimson.
One small house especially attracted my
attention, that of Maxime St. Germain—a real
old-fashioned humble country stone cottage, with
the cross standing, a rendezvous in old time for
prayer when churches were few and far between.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was told me that this Maxime St. Germain,
from a humble habitant, by the rise of the value
of his property, has risen to great wealth, though
still living in his humble way, and with his wife
and brother still occupy the old homestead.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To make one understand the beauty of
Moncklands, you must pay it a personal visit,
and, in default of that, I cannot do better than
copy a page of its prospectus.  I can only say
that I was utterly charmed even during my
hurried visit.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The view is so lovely from the front.  The
parlors so tastefully, even elegantly, furnished,
with a fine library in one of them, every token
of refinement, and the spirit of order prevails
with a carefulness of detail which must conduce
to the comfort of its inmates.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In this Institution for Young Ladies will be
found all the advantages, comfort, etc., in
harmony with its pre-eminence among the various
houses of this Order.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In point of situation, salubrity, and picturesque
scenery, Villa Maria is unrivalled; the
grounds are extensive, and comprise a delightful
grove and a lovely little lake, with gondolas,
for the healthful amusement of the pupils.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The house, which was formerly the residence
of the Governor-General of Canada, is fitted up
in a style of comfort and in a degree of elegance
not surpassed by any establishment of the kind.
French being the language of the Institution,
the pupils possess rare facilities for acquiring a
thorough and practical knowledge of this
language.  French conversation is compulsory,
and enters into the competition for the highest
honors.  The course in the English language is
thorough and complete.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Governor-General of the Dominion of
Canada has graciously given this institution a

<p class="pfirst"><span>I have just returned from Quebec, and must
record one of the most pleasurable incidents of
that visit, namely, my meeting accidentally an
old acquaintance, the handsome Miss Bouchette,
now Lady Shea, and her gifted husband, Sir
Ambrose Shea.  The pleasure of a prolonged
interview with the latter, and I must say an hour's
conversation with him, is an education.  He has
the happy gift of conveying so much information
in such easy flowing language, words seem to
come specially to express his meaning; you learn
so much while apparently only chatting.  Truly
may the Bahamas bless the day when he went
there, and evolved from the noxious weed they
complained of (Sisal Fibre) an industry which
will be its grand prosperity.  Already the
importance of this great branch of commerce has
been so great that he has, in view of Canadian
interests, come on a visit to Ottawa, to effect, if
possible, a divergence of the trade to Canada
instead of permitting our American Cousins to
reap all the profits.  He showed me a plait of
fibre about two feet long or more, so delicate
yet so strong.  There is no doubt it will produce
a rival to the famous manilla rope, and so
facile of handling, it may yet be used for
the manufacture of linen and other articles, for
it needs very little preparation for use, and that
of the simplest kind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This wonderful plant suddenly sprung into
prominent notice.  It is a weed particularly
fertile in the Bahamas.  It grows
about two feet high, and the fibre is the
length of the plant, and when extracted
by the simple process of pressing out,
and then wet and dried in the sun, looks
exactly like horse hair, and so strong one could
not break even four threads twined together.
This Sisal Fibre is creating such a sensation
now.  I need say nothing further on the
subject, only wish Sir Ambrose and his wife
a pleasant trip, and thank Mr. Russell for
the particular courtesy I received from him.
But when will you fail to receive attention at
the St. Louis!  From mine host down to the
humblest bell boy, all are so watchful for
your comfort, so civil in their demeanor, it is a
pleasure to put up there.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>On a recent visit to Quebec I was shown by
the present courteous and able manager, James
Stevenson, Esq., a notice he had written in the
</span><em class="italics">Shareholder</em><span>, February 22, 1884, and there is so
much of interest in it for the public, I transmit
the valuable information it contains to you, my
friends.  Mr. Stevenson had directed my attention
to this article, as he had therein so kindly
noticed my dear father, the late Charles
Gethings:—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Quebec Bank, with the exception of the
Bank of Montreal, is the oldest bank in the
Dominion.  On the 9th July, 1818, merchants,
and others interested in the establishment of a
bank in the city of Quebec, held a meeting at
the Exchange, and drafted articles of association.
The document is headed, "Articles of
Association of the Quebec Bank," and consists
of twenty-five sections.  No. 3 provides that,
for the good management of the bank, there
shall be thirteen directors; No. 6, that there
shall be no recourse upon the separate property
of any shareholder.  Other sections severally
provide for the issue of notes; the calling-up of
the capital, which is to be £75,000; the term of
the bank's existence; and its dissolution.  The
bank is now in its sixty-seventh year.
Distinguished men, legislators, lawyers and
merchants have served on the directorate.  During
the term of its existence it has been exposed to
severe financial storms; it has weathered them
all, preserved its capital intact, and has paid
several millions in the shape of dividends.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the first meeting of the shareholders, which
was held on the 7th September, 1818, the
following gentlemen were elected to serve on the
board of directors, namely, John W. Woolsey,
Thomas White, J. McCallum, John Jones,
Charles Smith, Louis Massue, Jean Langevin,
Henry Black, Ph. Aubert de Gaspé,
W. G. Sheppard, John Goudie, Etienne Lagreux,
and Benjamin Tremain.  Mr. Woolsey was
elected president, and Mr. White, vice-president;
and the Board engaged the services of
Noah Freer, as cashier.  Mr. Freer held a
commission as captain in the army; he had seen
service, and had been military secretary to Sir
George Prevost, during the war of 1812.
Steady-going merchants may have shrugged
their shoulders and questioned the wisdom and
propriety of appointing a soldier to such a
position; but Captain Freer took kindly to the
business of civil life.  He was accurate, precise,
and methodical in all he did; and a courteous
gentleman in his intercourse with the public.
The customers of the bank were men of high
standing—including the leading officials of the
capital, namely, the Governor-General, the
Bishop, the Commander-in-Chief, legislators and
lawyers, in addition to the regular commercial
clientele.  Holograph cheques of all its principal
customers since 1818 have been carefully
preserved in the bank, a review of which is almost
as interesting as a cursory perusal of the annals
of the city.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That able jurist, the late Honorable Andrew
Stuart, was appointed legal adviser; and he
appears on several occasions to have steadied
the directors, and guided them into a course of
safety.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the absence of an "Act of Incorporation,"
the shareholders no doubt incurred unlimited
liability to the depositors and share-holders; but
application was made to Parliament for a charter,
and an "Act of Incorporation," extending the
existence of the bank to 1831, was passed in
1819.  This Act received the Royal assent of
George IV. on the 16th September, 1822.  At
the expiration of the term, the charter was
renewed, and extended to the 1st August, 1836;
and, by a subsequent Act, to the same date in
1837.  That year constitutional government
was suspended in consequence of the disturbed
state of the Province; and all the powers and
privileges of the bank expired by the effluxion
of the time limited by the Act of Incorporation.
The directors were at a loss what course to
pursue under the circumstances.  They thought
seriously of winding up the bank.  In 1838 the
government of the country was vested in Sir
John Colborne, as Administrator, and a special
council held in the city of Montreal.  The same
year, the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended,
and an ordinance was passed authorizing the
incorporated, chartered, and other banks in the
Province to suspend the redemption of their
notes in specie till the 1st of June, 1839—limiting
the circulation of each bank to the amount
of its capital stock actually paid up.  It was
further enacted that all specie then held by the
bank should be retained, and should not be
sold, excepting to Her Majesty's Government.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Political disturbances having been quelled,
trade revived, and all thought of winding up
the bank was abandoned.  To supply the
absence of silver, the bank, in addition to its
ordinary issue, issued notes of 15d., or 30 sous,
and 2s. 6d., or 3 francs; and the several banks
struck off a copper currency for the convenience
of the public.  The suspension of specie
payments lasted three years.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the absence of Parliamentary authority
for the existence of the bank, the directors we
readvised to apply for a royal charter, and Captain
Freer, the cashier, was deputed to proceed to
England, for the purpose of communicating
with the Home Government on the subject.
Captain Freer was well received by the authorities,
and every assistance was rendered to him
in furtherance of the object of his mission.  A
royal charter was granted with authority to
apply to Parliament for a renewal as soon as
constitutional government should be restored;
at the same time the authorized capital of the
bank was increased to £100,000.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Several changes had taken place in the personnel
at the Direction since 1818.  In 1823,
Mr. W. Sheppard was elected president; in 1832,
Mr. Charles Smith; in 1838, Mr. John Fraser;
and in 1842, Mr. James Gibb.  In 1852 Captain
Freer retired from the service of the bank upon
a pension, having held office for thirty-four
years.  In 1848 Sir N. F. Belleau was elected
a director.  He has since been a constant
member of the Board, and punctual in his attendance,
even while he held the office of Lieutenant-Governor
of the Province of Quebec.  On the
death of the Honorable Andrew Stuart, the
Honorable Henry Black was appointed legal
adviser; and on his assuming the duties of
Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court, he was
succeeded by the Honorable George O. Stuart,
the present Judge of the same Court.  J. C. Vannovous,
Q.C., held the office till his death,
and was succeeded by the present legal
advisers of the bank, Messrs. Andrews, Caron &amp;
Andrews.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mr. Charles Gethings, a man of inflexible
integrity of character, was appointed to fill the
office of cashier, vacated by the retirement of
Captain Freer, and under his management, and
the careful supervision of the president,
Mr. Gibb, who was rarely absent from the office, the
bank continued to pay its dividends, namely,
in 1853 at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum:
in 1854, 7 per cent.; 1855, 7 per cent.; 1856,
7 per cent.; 1857, 6½ per cent.; 1858, 6 per
cent.; 1859, 6½ per cent.; 1860, 7½.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In 1860 the president, one of the oldest and
most esteemed merchants in the city, died,
deeply regretted by the whole community, and
Mr. W. H. Anderson, the vice-president, was
elected president in his place.  The following
year Mr. Gethings, the cashier, retired upon a
pension; and Mr. William Dunn, a gentleman
well qualified to fill an important place in any
bank, was appointed his successor.  The bank,
under his management, continued to pay
dividends, namely, in 1861, 8 per cent; 1862, 8 per
cent.; 1863, 7½ per cent.; 1864, 7 per cent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In 1864 Mr. David Douglas Young, a leading
and highly esteemed merchant, who had served
several years on the directorate, was elected
president.  Mr. Dunn, the cashier, retired soon
after his appointment, and was succeeded by
the present general manager, Mr. James Stevenson,
in December, 1864.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Since the death of Mr. Young, which happened
in 1869, the Honorable James G. Ross
has been president of the bank, and
Mr. William Withall, vice-president.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Such, in brief, is the history of this old
institution, the doors of which were opened for
business in 1818, in a small house in
Sault-au-Matelot Street.  Some years afterwards, a
portion of a commodious building erected by
the Quebec Fire Insurance Company, in Peter
Street, was occupied by the bank.  But in 1863
the directors resolved to have a building of
their own, and they purchased from Mr. H. Atkinson
the site upon which the present handsome
banking house is built.  A certain historical
interest attaches to almost every spot
and locality in Quebec; and to none more so
than to that very site.  There, on a cold stormy
December morning, in 1775, when the
simultaneous assault on Quebec was made by
Montgomery and Arnold, stood a small body of
resolute men, ready to sacrifice their lives in
defence of the city.  While the life of
Montgomery was ebbing away with the flow of his
blood at Cape Diamond, Arnold was advancing,
with a comparatively formidable force, from
St. Roch's, upon Sault-au-Matelot, a little lane not
over twelve feet wide, opposite the site of the
bank.  It is not too much to say that the fate
of Canada, as a dependency of Great Britain,
hung upon the issue of the impending contest
in the lane.  The struggle was a desperate one.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It lasted several hours; but the repulse was
complete; and Arnold, carried off wounded,
retired with the remnant of his force upon the
General Hospital, the head-quarters of the
Americans, which they held till the siege of
Quebec was abandoned in the following month
of May, 1776.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Near the site of the old convent just
described, we used to embark on a horse boat to
cross to Levis in summer, and in winter a canoe,
managed by expert boatmen, who paddled
their way through shoal ice, and, on reaching
any large piece, with wonderful strength and
skill raised the canoe and pulled it on the ice as
we do a sleigh.  These boatmen were so inured
to their work that an accident rarely happened.
But there are records of a whole canoe full of
people being swamped.  Fortunately a regular
service of ice boats exists in winter now, and
with rare intervals (some extraordinary storm)
with as much regularity as the summer ferry
boats.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Some of my young readers may never have
seen a horse boat, so I will tell them they
looked like some of the very small steamboats,
but the machinery was put in movement and
carried on by horses attached to a pole in the
centre and walking round and round.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Previous to the year 1857 there were no
other means of crossing to Levis but by the
canoes, when Capt. Semple chartered a boat,
which ran up to December, as it could only
go through floating ice.  But an enterprising
gentleman, the recently deceased Mr. Tibbits,
talking over the matter with a young relative
of mechanical genius, made out plans for
machinery, had them sent to Montreal, made
here and sent on to Quebec, were fitted up
and at once proved successful, and thus in
the year 1862 started his passenger boat, "The
Arctic," which would cut through the heaviest
ice and became a perfect success.  I copy from
a newspaper the following notice of Mr. Tibbits,
who died March 26, 1889:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"On Friday last the mortal remains of the
late James Tibbits were committed to their last
resting place in Mount Hermon Cemetery.
For many years the deceased was a prominent
figure in the mercantile community.  He was a
man of great physical and mental energy, and
of unbounded enterprise, always willing to risk
in public enterprises the money with which
many of his ventures were crowned.  One
lasting monument of his enterprise and ability
remains to us in the excellent ferry service we
enjoy with the South Shore.  He was the first
to demonstrate the possibility of a steamer
cutting its way through the masses of ice which
obstructed the navigation opposite the city
during the winter.  Like many others of our
enterprising merchants, Mr. Tibbits died poor.
Quebec owes his memory a debt of gratitude,
which might well have been slightly repaid by a
public funeral.  It is, however, such a long time
since Mr. Tibbits resided in the city, the
generation that succeeded are hardly aware of the
services rendered by the deceased.  It is not
fitting, however, that they should be lost sight of."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The ferry boats, summer and winter, land you
in close proximity to the railroad, and carriages
take you west towards St. David or east to
St. Joseph.  After driving up a very steep hill you
come to a road branching off to the west beside
which is the little old English Church and
Cemetery, the former being now renewed under the
supervision of its popular pastor, Rev. Mr. Nicholls,
grandson of the much-esteemed Bishop
Mountain.  Higher up and last is the Roman
Catholic parish church, a monument to the zeal
and perseverance of the late Rev. Mr. Dalzeil.
Almost a riot was in the parish when he asked
for it to be built of its present size, but with
far-seeing wisdom he insisted, and now it is crowded
to overflowing though two other churches have
been built in the space of the last few years.
Levis also possesses a fine college in this locality.
On the summit of the hill called rue des
Marchands is a very handsome and spacious store
and residence belonging to Mr. Couture, and
opposite to it is a tiny little building kept in good
repair, though unused, which Mr. Couture tells
you with pride is the shop where he first earned
the shillings which were to end by making him a
millionaire.  Mr. Edouard Couture carries on the
business in the same place now, but the
Hon. Geo. Couture, Senator, sleeps under a handsome
obelisk in Levis Cemetery.  The noblest monument
that exists to his memory, however, is the
beautiful church, built by money left for that
purpose in his will, adjoining the splendid
hospital, built within about ten years, to which
he contributed so largely during his lifetime.
One of the head ladies of the institution (a
very old friend, sister-in-law of our well-known
citizen, Hon. P. Casgrain) took me through
this building about a week ago, and I was
astonished to find it almost filled already.  The
poor, the crippled, old women, young children,
have here a comfortable home, with delightful
surroundings, and on a height and with
a view of the Citadel, Quebec.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Mère St. Monique asked me to go and
visit the Catacombs under the church, I decidedly
objected, but Josephte, as I called her in
our youth, always would have her way, and I
am glad she did so here, for I do not know
whether similar places for burial are existent
elsewhere in this country or only a new creation
in Canada, but I am glad I went into them.
This seems to be the perfection of burying.
Leading me through a long light passage under
the church, we came to a very heavy iron door;
then on its being opened a second appeared
with its blank emblems and death's head and
cross bones, sufficiently indicative of where we
were going.  Entering this door Mère St. Monique
struck a light, and we found ourselves in a
fire-proof brick chamber and passages.  On every
side shelves to hold one coffin.  There is only
one occupant so far—Mr. Gingras—but there
are places for ninety.  The coffin is placed on
a shelf just large enough, then masoned up,
and the name put on the masonry.  A great
improvement on old-fashioned vaults, as all
possibility of disturbance is precluded and no
danger from foul air.  This building is under
the High Altar, so to a devout Roman Catholic
much of the feeling of gloom is taken away.  A few
miles west is St. David's Church, a pretty new
edifice, and further on at the village of
St. Romuald, St. Romuald's Church, so filled with
choice paintings and works of art by its late
Pastor, the Rev. Mr. Saxe, it has become quite
a worthy show place for our sight-seeing
American friends.  The Rev. Mr. Saxe was of
such clever wit and genial presence, he
exercised great influence over those with whom he
came in contact.  I remember saying how
proud his parishioners must be of this lovely
little edifice.  "They well may be," he said, "it
has hardly cost them anything for all these works
of art.  I made the old country, that could
afford it, give them, you know.  I travelled
in Europe for contributions, and impressed on
each community how necessary it was that each
city should give of its best—something to
redound to its own credit, and I got it," the old
gentleman said with a merry twinkle in his
eye.  So much, my friends, for tact and a
knowledge of human nature.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Previous to the year 1853, or thereabouts, there
was no railroad below Quebec, and vehicles were
the only means of transport; but when time and
means permit, it is surely the most agreeable of
all ways of travelling.  We were frequent visitors
at Crane Island, and our downward drive to
St. Thomas, where we took sail boat to cross, were
in the habit of stopping at various way-side
houses, not inns, simply neat commodious places
where we were always expected and welcomed,
and sure of a meal and bed.  One of these was
the Fraser House at Beaumont: it still exists,
but sadly deteriorated, and occupied by a
French farmer and family.  It is a very long
low house in a very small quiet country village,
prettily situated with a view of the St. Lawrence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>On one occasion my husband and myself drove
up to the door.  "Welcome!" (we were frequent
visitors) "but it is well you did not come a few
days sooner.  Who do you think has just left?
Lord and Lady Elgin,"—and I forget whether
she said any children.  "Come, and I'll show you
the room as I arranged it for Lady Elgin."  If you
have never, my readers, seen a genuine
old-fashioned habitant bedstead, I would almost
fail to impress you with its height; you could
not possibly get into it without standing on a
chair, and two of these were placed side by
side, taking in one whole side of a room, with
the long white curtains pendant from a rod
attached to the ceiling.  I can hardly think of
it now without smiling.  Of course, it must
have been for the novelty of the thing that Lady
Elgin used it instead of having one brought
from Quebec.  Perhaps one gets so tired of
formality and grandeur, a change becomes a
welcome relief.  We said we had but twenty
minutes to stay, and must have lunch at once.
In about ten minutes we had a most delicious
fricassee of chicken in white sauce.  On
complimenting Mrs. Fraser, she said, "I learnt how to
make that from Lord Elgin's cook, and was I
not smart? those chickens were running about
when you came."  That spoilt all, ah—if she only
had not told us?  There are numerous pretty
villages all along the south shore.  None prettier
than that of St. Michel, adjacent to Beaumont.
It much resembles Kamouraska, though much
prettier as the foliage is so lovely.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>We resided there for a couple of years, and
then made the acquaintance of the Rev. Mr. Drolet,
who with his mother and sisters
tendered us such kindly hospitality.  The
Parsonage became to all of us a Maison Paternelle,
for the family all spoke English as well as
French, and the genial curé, a very clever and
devoted priest, was in his home an admirable
host.  I shall have occasion elsewhere to speak
of him.  I will conclude this article with a few
verses I found lately, written on the spur of the
moment from the circumstance of one of the
ladies nearly falling through a trap door into
the cellar of the dining-room of the
old-fashioned house we then occupied.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>We arrive at St. Thomas after a forty miles
drive, and stay over, if the tide does not serve
for coming, at Madame F.'s well-known hotel—not
far from which is the residences of the
late Sir Etienne Taché and Mr. Bender,
father of the present well-known Boston
physician, Dr. Bender.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A short distance from here is the house now
occupied by E. P. Bender, formerly owned by
Mr. William Patton, a splendid specimen of
an English gentleman.  A lumber merchant,
doing a large business with ample means, his
house was the home of generous hospitality.  It
is thirty years since I visited it or more—it then
gave you an idea of one of England's far-famed
country homes; Everything handsome, well
ordered grounds, its steel grates (then a novelty),
and handsome paperings, a host so courteous,
his wife a refined lady of the old school—all
appeared to promise long years of happiness
to its inmates, when in a day, alas! all was
changed.  Mr. Patton was most energetic in
his efforts to hasten the building of the
railroad from Quebec to St. Thomas, and went
into town to see Messrs.  Morton, Peto &amp;
Brassey, when he met his fate.  Overheated
by his exertions, he lay down to rest opposite
an open window facing the St. Lawrence, a
gale sprung up, he got a chill, and in twenty-four
hours he was dead, of inflammation, before
his wife could reach him, and yet she arrived
almost in time, due to a mysterious warning of
some kind, I forget what it was—she told me of
it herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Sitting quietly in her room she heard or saw
something, and, convinced that her husband
needed her, she ordered a carriage, and, despite
all remonstrance, drove all night, and passed in
the darkness the carriage sent for her, and
arrived in the grey dawn of morning to find her
husband just dead.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>How many such unaccountable occurrences
happen.  I could tell of at least six such
experiences in my own history.  My theory is this,
that under certain conditions thought meets
thought, and so mesmerically impresses on the
loved one its own yearnings and wishes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Previous to Mr. Patton's purchasing it, this
house had been occupied by several families of
note, the De Beaujeus, Olivas, etc.  It was
purchased a few years since by E. P. Bender, Esq.,
who now occupies it with his family.</span></p>

<p class="center pfirst" id="second-visit-to-roberval-lake-st-john"><span class="bold large">SECOND VISIT TO ROBERVAL,
<br />LAKE ST. JOHN.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>I was unfortunately prevented from visiting
Roberval until late in the season—in fact, only a
few weeks before the hotel closed—but I saw
enough to confirm my first impressions as to
its desirability as a summer resort for people
who really need to recuperate after the wear
and tear of town life.  It was late in August, a
cold spell was on; we arrived per railroad on
Pullman car, which brings you to the very gate
of the hotel premises.  A dull heavy rain came
down as we got off the cars, but what of
that? you are ushered into a hallway where burns a
generous grate fire.  Courteous officials greet
you and inquire your wants.  Shown to a
comfortable bedroom, and then to a supper as good
in quality as meals served in most town hotels,
with excellent attendance, you fancy you are in
fairy land, as, gazing on the wild country around,
you remember that this locality a few years ago
was not even inhabited by farmers, but all was
bush.  Ushered into the ladies' parlor you are
greeted by a most winning hostess, Mrs. Scott,
daughter of the Honorable Mr. Shehyn, who,
residing here at present with her children, does the
honors, and welcomes you as if to her own
private parlor.  The season was so nearly over
there were comparatively few guests, but those
of the most pleasant—Dr. and Mrs. Lovely,
Rev. Mr. —— and his wife, and several members of
the Beemer family, who by their musical talents
contributed largely to our enjoyment.  Roberval
I am sure has a grand future before it.
Dr. Lovely, one of the most eminent physicians of
the United States, assured me that he had
discovered coal-oil there, not five miles from the
hotel, and also some stone (I forget what) of
which he was taking specimens away with him.
He said if it was what he thought, it would
indeed be a bonanza.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It appears to me that Roberval would be
especially beneficial for those suffering from
nervous exhaustion or debility, or tendency to
consumption.  The pure mountain air, the quiet, the
absence of rush and excitement, must surely be
most grateful to such parties, while for those
who want a livelier existence, the trips in
excursion steam-boats, the visits to various other
fishing grounds, the power of jumping on the
railroad that comes to your door and whirls you
off for a few hours to other lakes, is a matter
not to be lost sight of.  Added to the perfect
inside comfort of this hotel—baths on your
bedroom flat—the immense piazza runs the full
length of the building, affording in wet weather
an excellent promenade, with a view of the
lovely lake, and what I much appreciated was
the absence of the horrid gong calling you to
meals.  Here you are told the time for meals,
and if you so desire a civil waiter calls you at the
hour you name, but the fearful din that
elsewhere rouses you from your pet morning sleep
is absent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Entering the ladies' parlor in the evening
you feel almost that you are in a private
house.  A bright fire burns in an open
grate.  Some fair lady is employing her talents
at the piano in your service, and you enjoy some
really good music, when one of the ladies asks
are you to have a little dance or a small game
of cards—the first at once, the latter when we
are tired.  After a short time small tables are
brought in, the guests group into little coteries,
each one retires when he will, after enjoying all
the comforts of a home with the liberty of an
hotel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I must not forget to state that at the village,
about a mile from the hotel, is a Roman Catholic
Church and fine Ursuline Convent, a delightful
boarding school for young ladies, who enjoy
boating every day and pleasant little trips to an
island now belonging to the Nuns.  There is
also a telegraph in the hotel, and any amount
of vehicles and horses and boats for visitors—also
cheaper boarding houses in the village for
those who require them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>During the few days I stayed there, one or
two funny incidents occurred.  On one occasion
I had an old man to drive me, when I said, "I
hope it will not rain before we get home."  "I
hope it won't, indeed," he said, "I am not dry
yet since yesterday."  "How is that?" I asked.
Said he: "I was out with that party from the
hotel who when out fishing were so drenched, and
the storm being so great I stayed by the hotel
kitchen fire instead of going home to change;
but, madame," as a sudden thought struck him,
"you live at the hotel, is there a doctor living
there?"  Having been there only a few hours,
I did not know, but inquired why he asked.
"The fact is, I hear that when people come
from Louisiana or Paris, a party of ten always
brings a doctor with them" (a party
recently arrived just numbering ten), "and
hearing that I had a son ill, one gentleman said if I
would take him to see my son or bring my son
to him, he would try and cure him."  "Well,"
I asked, "have you done so?"  "But no," he
said, "he is English."  (I spoke in French and he
thought I was a French Canadian.)  "What
difference would that make?"  "Why, madame, do
you think the English know anything?"  "Well,"
I said, "perhaps a little; you might try the
doctor."  At the same time I was quite
prepared to hear that he was a victim of some
practical joke from his statement that every ten
persons coming from Louisiana or Paris brought
a doctor with them; I little expected the
dénouement.  "Oh! my son would not see him at
all.  He said, 'father, do you wish me to die
at once?'  But, madame, I would not have
minded taking him to the doctor myself.  You
don't think that even though English he would
have given him something to kill him at once?"
"Oh! no," I answered, "I am sure he would
not do that."  But my story does not end here.
On entering the parlor, where several were
seated, I addressed a peculiarly pleasant lady
near me, and began to narrate for their benefit
my conversation with the old driver, when I
noticed my hearer give a kind of warning glance:
and then she went off into a merry peal of
laughter as the door opened and a gentleman
popped in his head.  "Come here, my dear, learn a
lesson of humility.  This, my dear lady, is my
husband, Dr. Lovely" (I have learned since that he
is one of the most well-known of American
physicians); "he is the Englishman, who can't
know anything."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The doctor, who enjoyed the joke, engaged the
same driver next day to have his fun as much
as anything.  After a good deal of skirmishing,
he elicited all from the old coachman, who,
however, said, though English, if Dr. L——
was a Roman Catholic, he might induce his son
to trust him, as he believed that the little
bottles he showed him really contained </span><em class="italics">des
remèdes</em><span>.  I know that the doctor explained to
him that, though not a Roman Catholic, he
attended nearly all the members of that
denomination in the United States, and there was some
kind of negotiation going on when I left.  They
may have come to terms, and the boy cured,
despite himself.  Perhaps this poor old chap,
living for many years utterly isolated from
civilization, might have the same horror of </span><em class="italics">Les
terribles Anglais</em><span> that the English peasantry
had of Napoleon the First, who, when children
were refractory, were threatened to be given to
'Bonaparte.  And, now, as some of our English
people may be hard on this old French-Canadian,
I must tell you that the clergyman's
wife, attached to some very prominent hospital
in one of the large cities of the United States,
said they came across sometimes very odd
cases, and instanced that of a patient coming
to the hospital, and, being ordered to take a
bath, said he had never taken a bath in his life,
and must go home and consult his wife.  He
went and never returned!!!  This, in one of
the largest cities of America.  So don't too
much despise the old backwoodsman's prejudice.
As Mrs. Lovely most kindly invited me to pay
her a visit, I may yet tell you more about this
very true tale.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="center pfirst" id="st-leon-springs"><span class="bold large">ST. LEON SPRINGS.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It is fully fifty years ago since my father
took me to Three Rivers en route for St. Leon
Springs.  We were most hospitably received
by Mr. Lajoie (father of the present dry goods
merchant of Three Rivers), and his good lady,
and Mr. Faucher de St. Maurice, father of the
present gentleman of the same name.  Of the
party were, I think, Mr. Gingras, whose son,
brother-in-law of Mr. Dorion, recently deceased,
was the first I think to establish the reputation
of these waters.  After a sumptuous repast at
Mr. Lajoie's, we were driven to St. Leon Springs,
and this us what I remember of it then: a steep
sandy hill, up which was walking a pale, thin
young lady, whom my father pointed out to me
as Miss G——; that lady has been in bed
seven years, you see her walking now; whether
the cure was permanent or not I have no means
of ascertaining, but Mr. Campbell, late proprietor
of St. Leon Springs, told me only two weeks
since that he remembered Miss G—— perfectly.
Mr. Campbell further told me since that his
father had noticed the cattle drinking at this
spring, and finding it had a peculiar taste, had it
analyzed, and gave to the public this boon for
the afflicted, and health-preserving drink for the
sick.  We had tea that day at the Springs on a
deal table, without table-cloth, seated on wooden
benches, while carpenters were putting the roof
on a large building we sat in.  I presume this
was the first hotel, rather a contrast to that of
the present day, which is yearly crowded with
an increased number of fashionable visitors from
all parts of the Dominion, in search of health
or amusement.  This hotel has been very lately
enlarged and fitted up with every modern
convenience.  Parties leaving Montreal by the
Canadian Pacific Railroad, and getting off at
Louiseville, will find vehicles waiting to take
them to St. Leon Springs.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This lady just alluded to, Miss G——, was
one of those peculiar patients one hears of in a
lifetime, and, as all her near relatives are dead
and few will recognize the initial, I will inform
my readers that Dr. A——, one of my father's
physicians (now deceased), told me that she
was afflicted with a kind of fit—cataleptic, I
think, they called it—when she fell into a
state so closely resembling death that two of
Quebec's most prominent medical men were
about to perform a post-mortem examination
on her, when the slight quiver of an eyelid
proved her still alive, and on her recovering
she told them that, though unable to make the
slightest motion, she had heard and seen all
that had passed, and Dr. A—— was exceedingly
indignant that such a subject should have
been sent to him as an ordinary patient, as the
same thing might have occurred again.  He
was, if I mistake not, then residing in Halifax
and he told me that all the instructions he
received were to provide a suitable lodging for
a nervous patient, who could afford to pay well
for a quiet private residence.  Accordingly,
Dr. A—— persuaded a well-to-do Scotch
farmer to take her as a boarder.  For a time
all went well, though she would go off into a
sort of trance, when she lay apparently dead
for perhaps three days and returned to
consciousness, often cognizant of what had occurred
during her semi-deathlike state.  But on one
occasion her second sight, if you can so term
it, was so great, she terrified the old people so,
they begged the doctor to remove her, saying
she was no canny.  The facts were these:—On
one occasion Miss G—— fell into her
cataleptic state, and the doctor not expecting
her to revive before a certain time, said he
would not call till the following Thursday.  But
on the Tuesday, receiving a summons from a
very old patient, twenty miles distant, he
decided on calling on her </span><em class="italics">en route</em><span>.  The
weather being rainy, he asked for a covered
vehicle, and the only one procurable was a
shabby, very old-fashioned waggon.  In the
meantime, Miss G—— awoke from her trance,
and said, "the doctor is coming."  "No," said
the mistress of the house; "he is not coming
till Thursday."  "He is coming now," said
Miss G——, "he is at the red gate" (a gate
some distance from the back of the house, and
too far for any sound to reach)—"what a funny
carriage he has."  When he really drove up in
this queer-looking vehicle, the landlady was so
scared, she uttered that exclamation, "she is
no canny," and insisted that board should be
taken elsewhere.  I offer no explanation—let
the savants do that—I only narrate facts I
vouch for.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Going by the Canadian Pacific Railroad to
Louiseville, we took a trap awaiting at the
station, and, after a drive over a rather
pretty country road, arrived at St. Leon
Springs.  Alas! the season was over, only
Mr. Thomas and his son, and Mr. Langlois, were
there, and a few servants.  Nevertheless, we
saw enough to convince us what a delightful
health resort this must be in summer.  When I
say health resort, I do not mean pleasure resort,
though there is plenty of amusement for
reasonable people, who would find pleasant
companionship, dancing, music, drives, croquet,
lawn-tennis sufficient for summer heat; but,
we speak now of St. Leon Springs as a retreat
for the really ill or convalescent, and as such it
must simply be perfection.  A large hotel, nicely
kept, numerous bath-rooms, all fitted up with
an abundant supply of St. Leon water for
bathing, excellent meals, well-cooked and nicely
served, as we saw even during our brief and
unexpected stay (I have never eaten such
perfect home-made bread as there), with the
drinking of these health-giving waters, must
surely be of incalculable benefit.  Twitting
Mr. Langlois on the supposition that perhaps
in cities the St. Leon water is in part
manufactured, Mr. Langlois told us a funny incident.
He said, I think it was in Toronto, he
overheard some one saying, as his trucks came in
loaded with barrels: "I wonder how much of
this is manufactured?"  On the impulse of the
moment, Mr. L—— gave a hint to the carters
to dump the casks on the pavement instead of
taking them through the yard.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As anticipated, a policeman came up and
remonstrated on impeding the sidewalk.  Soon
a crowd gathered.  Just what Mr. L—— desired.
When spoken to, he said: "Of course, it was an
oversight, the water should have been taken
into the yard; but as it was there, he would
like to prove to the people assembled how
genuine was the water, by tapping several
barrels, and, igniting with a match the gas, said:
"My friends, can any of you manufacture gas
in water to burn like this?"  Mr. L—— is not
by any means a man you would credit with
being a religious enthusiast; but I will never
forget the solemnity of the act, as, raising his
hand towards Heaven, he uttered these words:
"He who made these waters can alone make
the gas."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mr. Thomas, a wealthy gentleman, with his
son, for health and occupation, takes the
management here.  The latter, quite a sport,
drove us with his blood horses to the station, at
a pace that made me tremble.  There a grand
old-fashioned coach with four spanking horses
waits at the railroad station to drive you in
style to the hotel.  Come and try them, my
fast American friends.  I will conscientiously
stick to the old-fashioned one-horse buckboard—not
elegant and hardly comfortable, but very safe.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>About eight years ago my dear husband and
myself took rooms for the summer with a
Mr. Ignace Déry, a carpenter.  The house, a very
large one of many buildings, was prettily
situated on the banks of the river.  Facing the
house an immense barn indicated the prosperity
of the farm.  In course of conversation I remarked
to Mr. D. how astonished I was to find such a
handsome church, fine shops, and a musical
choir, with a thriving village, in a place we had
only heard of a few years before.  "You will
be more surprised, dear lady," he said, "when
I inform you that I came here fifty years ago,
a boy of fifteen, against my people's will, with
another cousin, and broke the first road in
what was all then bush."  "How did you
hear of this place at all?"  "Well, from the
Indians, and I went out with the surveyors and
thought what a splendid place it was for a
settlement, and said so, but my father would
not hear of it.  However, one day, my cousin,
Joseph Déry, said to me after church, 'Have
you decided on coming to squat or take
possession and make an opening on these
lands?'  'My family will not hear of it,' I
answered.  'Well, then, come without their
leave; if they see you succeed, they will
be quite satisfied.'"  So Déry and his cousin
started off right after mass, the equipment of
the former being a loaf of bread and piece of
pork procured from his sister, whom he let
into the secret, about half a bag of potatoes
for seed, a hatchet, and his working clothes
and a little salt.  The boys walked out about
fifteen miles: the one, my friend Déry, remained
at the east end, his cousin at the west.  These
two houses now form the boundary in a certain
measure of the village of St. Raymond.  Mr. Déry
told me his first occupation was to plant
some potatoes, then build a small hut, and he
said for food he had only to dip a line into the
river back of the site of his house to procure
all the fish he needed.  On this he lived, with
fruit and a little flour procured later.  Such
was the commencement of this prosperous
village.  The cousin, Joseph Déry, still kept
a few years ago intact his first cottage, though
building a comfortable house beside it.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>In the autumn we moved for a month nearer
the village, and occupied the house owned by
Mr. Beaupré.  It was a commodious dwelling,
neatly furnished, and on my remarking a
rather nice bureau in my room, and inquiring
if they had a cabinet-maker in the village, my
landlady answered, "Oh! my husband made
that himself, and, though never apprenticed to
any trade, built nearly the whole of this house
himself."  and then the old gentleman, pointing
to the other side of the river, said, "Do you
notice, madame, that clump of trees; well,
beneath that rock is a cavern which I
discovered and made a residence of when, as a
boy of thirteen, I walked from St. Augustine
across the country to there, to see what I could
do for myself.  I had no near relations, and
determined if possible, by squatting, to get a
home.  I built a projecting porch, and lived
for many a month in that cavern.  I earned
my living by doing odd jobs for the farmers,
who came from some distance, and helped to
row them over in a scow to St. Raymond
proper, now the village, to get their horses
shod, and while waiting for their return, noticed
how the blacksmiths worked; then it occurred
to me how well a blacksmith would do on my
side of the river (thus saving the crossing), and
I commenced to learn, and here I am, the
master of a comfortable home and several
farms"—the reward of energy and favorable
circumstances, which brought the railroad to
their very doors, and with large stores opening
for the supply of the railroad employees, and
the influx of summer visitors, has made the
desert blossom like a rose, and a charming
village (the intersecting waters spanned by a
pretty bridge), spring in a few years from the
bush.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I have just returned from St. Raymond and
learnt some additional facts anent the Dérys
I found interesting, and detail them for public
benefit.  The daughter-in-law of Joseph Déry
said her father-in-law was the first, except
sportsmen and Indians, who had ever been to
St. Raymond; a little pathway through the
woods was their inroad.  He started to find
the River St. Anne, which runs through St. Raymond;
he found his walk very fatiguing from
Lorette, and arriving at the Cape, under which
runs the St. John railway now, was delighted to
find he was nearing his destination.  He named
the hill Cap Joyeuse, which name it still bears.
On wishing to see the first cabin he had built, she
said, by recent surveys, it would be situated in
the middle of the river, as the waters of the St
Anne river had gradually washed the bank away.
The end of the first cottage built is still extant,
every plank used in it being sawed by hand,
and the portrait of Mr. Joseph Déry hangs on
its walls.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>I do not know that I ever heard much of
St. Augustin in my earlier days, except as the
residence of Mr. Gale, an oldtime school master,
who fixed his residence there, and taught many
of the (after) prominent men of Quebec.  His
wife, a prim little lady of wax-doll complexion
and flaxen hair done up in frizzes, was quite a
character as well as her husband.  A very
kind-hearted little lady she was, with a peculiar gift of
hospitality, and her cakes and home-made wine
were of wide renown.  Mr. Gale had a taste for
antiquities; a small museum, in great part
contributions of curiosities, the gifts of his admiring
scholars, was one of his cherished parlor ornaments.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>About seventy-five years ago or more a wealthy
Englishman, John S. Campbell, came out from
the old country and commenced a large business
in lumber and ship building at the part of
St. André called Pointe Sèche.  Here he built a
beautiful residence with every luxury and
appliances then known, splendid walks in the
shrubbery, beautiful gardens, and even a residence
for a physician, as at that time there was
a great deal of ship fever, and he employed a
great number of workmen in his ship building
and other mercantile business.  He brought out
his wife (with her lady's maid), who, accustomed
to society life, must have been indeed startled at
the contrast of her surroundings, for here she
was virtually in a wilderness.  It is true that
previous to the railroad from Quebec to the
lower ports, these same villages had much more
life in a business point than to-day, for then all
travellers stopped at the wayside inns, and there
being no facilities for going or coming from
Quebec, the shopkeepers who brought down in
their schooners goods at certain seasons of the
year did a fine business, and really large
fortunes were made by many: an apt illustration
of the truth of the vulgar old proverb, "that
what is one man's meat is another man's poison,"
for the railroad, which is such a boon to the
farmers and those bordering its route, has proved
utterly destructive to the old-fashioned inns and
shops on the old route, for the transfer being
solely by vehicles, a regular influx of travellers
was expected and received, thus giving life to
the village and current cash.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mr. J. S. Campbell and his lady becoming
after some years thoroughly disgusted,
abandoned the place, and so swiftly, I many years
after, about forty years ago, found a book
belonging to the family in the disused dining-room.
I heard from one of the family to-day
who own this lovely property now, and use it
as a summer residence (Mrs. Rankin of Dorchester
street), that a caretaker had been left in
charge of the property; if so, his conscience
must have been very lax, for it was the custom
of all those giving picnics at Kamouraska, who
wished to do so, to use the house as well as the
grounds, and to simply walk in at open doors and
take temporary possession.  Well, on one
occasion my father-in-law's family had a kind of
picnic, but, though going up to the Campbell
grounds, had brought their provisions to a neat
little wayside inn a short distance, from the mill
and wharf built by the aforesaid J. S. Campbell;
and as I always preferred a quiet read to those
excursions (I fear I am naturally rather lazy),
I said I would await their return at the small
hotel—its quiet and cleanliness were very
inviting.  "But," said Mr. McP. (I think I hear
the words as he addressed me often in fun),
"Mistress Charlotte, if you stay behind, you
are responsible for the dinner."  I promised in
good faith, and with a firm resolve of doing my
duty, that all should be in order on their return,
and, telling the landlady at what hour lunch
must be ready, made arrangements for an hour
of delightful repose, by ensconcing myself into
the most cosy of sofas with an interesting novel.
As the old grandmother's clock tolled forth the
midday hour, it struck me I had better see how
the dinner was progressing for the hungry folks
expected soon.  Fortunately, I did not delay,
for, to my dismay, I found the lamb-chops put
to boil, and the green peas frying in the
frying-pan.  By hastily changing their positions, I
managed matters so as to disguise my carelessness,
and so all was well that ends well.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A thoroughly respectable house like the
Campbell House, of Pointe Sèche, could not
be without its ghost, and it's doubly guaranteed
by having two of them: one a lady who is heard
to moan and sob and say she was shut up from
every one (it is presumed Mrs. C., who,
instead of dying of ennui and country fare,
took the more sensible plan of returning to
England); the other, the apparition of a
gentleman, supposed to have been murdered
because he disappeared—a rejected suitor put
on board a vessel by Mr. C. for making too
violent love to a cousin and quarrelling with a
more favored lover.  I have exorcised several
ghosts already, and would like to try my
observations on those inhabitants of a higher, or,
more likely, our earthly sphere, to whom the
unoccupancy of this fine mansion might be a
convenience.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>So called from the tremblings of constant
earthquakes, which with apparent volcanic
action has thrown up hill after hill so steep.  I can
compare the ascent and descent to nothing else
but a winter sleighing slide.  In fact, the hills are
almost perpendicular, and almost inaccessible to
a nervous party, who in descending feels as if he
must fall on the horse's tail, and ascending drop
out of the cart behind.  Yet to the young
and active it is a wild, lovely summer resort, its
unusual scenery presenting a most pleasurable
and novel spectacle.  In fact, my friends, if you
have a desire to visit Switzerland and cannot
compass it, just go to Les Eboulements, and very
little imagination will help you to transport
yourself there.  Cradled in mist, perched on some
rocky elevation, with the simple people about
you, you can easily deem yourself in the land of
William Tell.  But, did I say simple? yes, with
a spice of modern craft, for I well remember a
friend being ill asking me, as it was a
non-licensed place, to ask the landlady for a little
stimulant of any kind, as she might give it to me
instead of a gentleman.  The answer to my
demand was the query, "What would you have?"  "Well,
if possible, port wine," and a bottle of
excellent quality was forthcoming, and also the
remark, "if more is required, in fact, as much as
is necessary can be obtained.  We have plenty
for our own use."  As these people were great
fish traders with St. Pierre Miquelon, in view of
recent developments as to the smuggling
business I have my thoughts, but as I believe in
free trade between all nations, and I should
think it no sin to smuggle myself, I do not
condemn them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Apropos of smuggling, a funny incident came
under my observation.  A young married cousin
some years ago lived on the border dividing
Canada from the United States, and while (with
the fresh memory of the Fenian raids) countenanced,
as was said, by the Americans, expressed
great dislike to Brother Jonathan.  He dubbed
her a thorough Yankee, and she proved herself
a very cute one.  Well, these ladies had been
accustomed under lax custom house discipline
to drive over to St. Albans and purchase many
effects, cotton especially, at a very much less
price than on Canadian soil, and were very
indignant when a new official was appointed,
who openly boasted that no tricks would be
played upon him.  That was enough for my
sprightly cousin.  She arranged a plan with her
sister, went over in a light waggon, and when
stopped at the frontier by the aforesaid young
clerk on her return, who, with many apologies,
requested leave to search her vehicle, answered
in a tone of impatience, "Well, search my
waggon as much as you please, but don't wake my
baby."  She held in her arms a good-sized
baby in long clothes, a heavy veil covering the
face.  The official searched and found nothing
contraband.  He was, however, very much
disgusted to hear later that the baby was a mass
of dress and cotton goods, and that Mrs. K., as
she walked up and down the platform soothing
her supposed infant, was inwardly chuckling
over her clever trick played on the too confident
custom house clerk.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Fifty years ago Quebec was a prominent military
station, and from that circumstance, as well
as the fact that it counted amongst its members
so many of the truly good old French families
of the </span><em class="italics">ancienne noblesse</em><span>, there was then none
of that petty jealousy between French and
English.  They had fought valiantly, but when
peace was declared they shook hands heartily
and became friends.  The English reserve was
tempered by French suavity, and as Captain
Warburton, in his Stadacona </span><em class="italics">Feuilleton</em><span>, says,
"There were such a number of pretty girls in
Quebec, and so attractive, such pleasant
manners, combining maidenly reserve with refined
out-spokenness, they were irresistible, and some
English mammas, it was said, murmured sadly
when they heard their darling sons were to be
sent to Canada, fearing they would be effectually
captured, as they certainly would be, in the silken
but enduring nets of the fair demoiselles;
however, they must have been satisfied eventually,
for the ladies of whom the military gentlemen
deprived us of have done credit to their native city."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Old Quebecers will remember Miss L., wife
of General Elliot; Miss A., wife of General
Pipon; Miss P., wife of General Shakspeare,
and dozens of others; but I have before me
at least twenty beautiful and accomplished
ladies, our society belles who accompanied the
red coats to England.  What a different aspect
Quebec wore when the military were first taken
away! it seemed as if the silence of death
reigned, and why all should have been taken
has ever been an unanswered question.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Of people prominent in society in my early
days were Mr. Lemesurier, Judge McCord,
Mr. Berthelot (he gave me a French grammar, I
remember, he had published; he was father-in-law
of Sir Louis LaFontaine), Mr. Faribault, the
Hon. John Malcolm Fraser, Mr. Symes, whose
pretty and amiable daughter married the
son of the Empress Eugenie's trusty friend,
the Marquis de Bassano.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Besides the house occupied by the Hon. George
Primrose, there was at that time but one
small house used by the military, and now the
site of the splendid residence of the
Hon. Mr. Thibodeau, facing the Governor's garden.  At
the intersecting street facing the river is the
old Langham house, still occupied by her
grand-daughter, Mrs. T.; a few doors from
there the residence of Chief Justice Bowen,
whose ladies entertained a great deal, and
one of whose daughters was the wife of the
late Rev. Mr. Houseman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>We will take a skip now to where Palace
gate formerly stood, and watch G. H. Parke,
Esq., a noted whip (father of Dr. Parke), and
see him guide his tandem through one of the
sally-ports to the houses of the members of the
tandem, who could in vain hope to follow him.
Mr. P., who delighted in guiding the club through
most intricate places, had taken the measure of
the sally-port and knew his cariole would pass
through, and thus triumphantly headed the
others, who feared to follow him.  Should he
read this account of his old exploit, I am sure
it would yet bring up a smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The remembrance of this feat recalls a story
I have heard of the time of the noted Chamberlain
gang.  There were no houses at one time
between the grand house here and a large one
opposite St. Patrick's church, at that time
occupied by Miss or Mrs. M., an elderly
lady of ample means, who occupied the
present residence of J. Scott, Esq., formerly the
home of Mr. Faucher de St. Maurice.  This
Chamberlain was the leader of a notorious gang,
who for some time held Quebec in a state
of terror; their rapacity, cruelty and audacity
exceeded anything ever before seen, and they
continued their course with impunity till a
most providential circumstance caused their
discovery.  Well, one of their exploits was to
get one of their gang into Mrs. M.'s as
ostensible man servant to rob the house.  Late at
night one of the maids discerned a light in
the basement and heard voices, indicating
that there were robbers in the dwelling.  She
thought for a moment of trying to run and get
help from the guard, but fearing that unlocking
the back door might arouse the burglars, she
decided on barricading the room in which her
mistress slept, hoping to be able to call for
help to some passer-by; but alas! none came;
the robbers came up, quickly destroyed her
barricade, and though she fought bravely
with some fire-wood,—the only weapon at her
hand—was overpowered, gagged, tied up with
her mistress in a carpet, and so left for hours.
When the milkman and butcher came and
called ineffectually for admittance, the doors
were forced, and they were released after much
suffering; such was a sample of some of their
exploits.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Leaving St. Patrick's church, nearly
opposite this residence, we go on to and up
Esplanade Hill, till we come to a pretty little
church, and it was the sacrilege perpetrated
here that was the cause of their discovery.
Amongst other articles they had stolen a solid
silver statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Every
effort was made to trace the thieves, but
ineffectually, till the curiosity of an old country
woman found them out.  Somewhere, I think, back
of Point Levis, there lived a Canadian farmer,
whose old domestic had become very much
disgusted at the changed aspect of the home—from
a respectable, quiet domicile it had become
a most disorderly house; half intoxicated people
coming in and out at all hours, arriving with
carioles loaded with things kept out of her
sight.  She noticed that she was always sent off
while they unloaded, and they made their way
to a hut in the woods built for boiling maple
sugar, and that huge fires were built, though no
sugar was made.  Finally, she followed the
gang secretly, and went close enough to hear,
though not to see, what was going on, and
overheard these words uttered: "I am very
sorry for you, my poor little virgin, but you
must boil in the pot too.  Ah! I'll keep this
little finger to remember you by."  Horrified
beyond expression, the old woman returned
swiftly to the house and kept a terrified
watch; her master came in, and most of
the men drove off; but the one whose voice
she had recognized was so intoxicated that he
fell into a heavy sleep, and out of his pocket
fell the tiny silver finger of the statue.  Seizing
the first opportunity, she sought the parish
priest and told him all.  He at once connected
the small finger with the recent church
robbery, enjoined the most absolute silence on
the woman, and advised her for her own sake
as well as that of others to go about her work
as usual and so excite no suspicion.  In the
meantime he communicated with the authorities,
who wisely determined to make no display
of their knowledge, as the silver was melted
and all traces destroyed; but on the occasion
of the next burglary, a posse of police
instantly surrounded the place, and effectually
captured in time the whole gang, several of
whom were hanged.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They owed their long immunity to the fact
that several people of position were implicated.
Some, against their will, too terrified to break
from them.  One man, on the scaffold,
confessed that a young man unwarily brought into
their meshes had begged leave to be permitted
to break off from them on his taking oath never
to betray them.  A seeming acquiescence was
yielded, and an appointment made to take a
row on the river to negotiate where no one could
overhear their conversation.  As soon as out of
sight and sound the man confessed he had
silenced him effectually by a knock on the head
and a pitch into the river.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Leaving the little church on the Esplanade,
on reaching St. Ann, and turning to the left, at
the top of Ursule hill, you find a double brown
house, with peculiar pointed turret windows.
Here I lived when about eight years old, but
most distinctly do I remember its surroundings.
Come in and sit with me in the end parlor
window and I will point out to you Colonel
(afterwards General) Macdonald, in his brave
uniform, the picture of dignity, coming down,
the steps of the building formerly occupied by
Dr. Boswell; also the house where Dr. Lemieux
now lives, some officers (Guards, I think) had
their quarters, and pretty lively quarters they
were.  Most of these gentlemen were rich, young,
full of fun, and quite regardless of consequences.
One of their eccentricities was to insist on a
favorite horse being brought in by the front
door and harnessed in one of the large rooms
off the entrance.  I used to watch these
proceedings with great glee.  No doubt they paid
richly for their whistle when settling day came
with their landlord.  But they could well afford
to pay for their pranks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Opposite this house, the door facing Ann
street is still the solid residence, the home
some years since of the much-lamented Judge
Alleyne; in the early days I speak of, the
house of Mr. Le Mesurier, a merchant then,
but previously an officer in ——, and carrying
a reminder of the same in an empty sleeve,
a noble mark of valor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To be a good carver was then an absolute
necessity, for all carving was done at table, and
Mr. Le Mesurier piqued himself on always
discharging this duty himself, which he did most
skillfully by means of a peculiarly constructed
knife and fork.  Once seated at a side-table (I
had been invited to tea with some of the
younger members of the family), I watched him
do so with great admiration.  I do not recall
precisely who else were there; but one figure is
specially impressed on my memory, that of
Mrs. Kerr (mother of the late Judge Kerr), a
very stately lady in pink silk and high white plumes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Le Mesurier, although at the head of
fashionable society, was one of the old-time
good housekeepers.  I think I see her now
with her keys in hand, giving directions to some
domestic.  She had a large family—all popular;
but the two special favorites were, I think,
Miss Harriet, who is married to General Elliot,
and Henry Le Mesurier, whose former lovely
residence on the St. Lewis road still exists.
He had a peculiarly winning charm of manner,
inherited, as I saw in a very short interview I
had with him, by his son George.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I will now take you up the Esplanade and
stop at a cut-stone house on the corner of
St. Lewis road, once used as the residence of the
Lieut.-Governor.  It was conveniently situated,
and there was great indignation expressed when
the project was mooted of buying Spencer
Wood, for, though in most respects suitable,
many said it was too far, for those whose position
entitled them to vice-regal entertainments would
find horse hire a heavy tax.  For, my friends, in
those early days the almighty dollar was not
worshipped as now; in fact, very few of those
moving in the highest society were rich—good
family, culture and education were the tests, and
no amount of money would have introduced a
vulgar person into the charmed circle; in fact,
permission to subscribe to the Quebec assemblies
was a matter of almost as great moment as
admittance to old London Almacks.  An instance of
which may be found in this over-true tale told me
by an aged aunt who knew all the circumstances.
Briefly, it was this: A rich tradesman lived on
Mountain Hill, who had a pretty wife, who, not
content with every needful luxury for her happiness,
must needs sigh for, to her, the unattainable
(that was </span><em class="italics">entrée</em><span> to the castle).  On one
occasion a military gentleman of high position
who owed this tradesman some money said he
regretted the circumstance, and that if he would
give him time he would do anything possible
for him in return.  "Well," said Mr. Blank, "if
you could do something for my wife, I should
not only consider the bill paid, but be grateful
too."  "What is asked?" said the colonel.  "Just
this: you see, sir, my wife is young, and has
taken it into her foolish little head she must get
to one of the castle balls.  Could you get her
in?"  "Nothing easier, my dear sir; on my arm she
can come in unquestioned."  So grand preparations
were made by the lady, and at the appointed
time she went to the castle, triumphant,
on her cavalier's arm, advanced to the
door where the cards of admission were
received, when the official in waiting said, "Enter,
colonel, but Mrs. —— is not known here, where
is her invitation?"  Mortified to death, it was
said that Mrs. Blank, unwilling to face the
occupants of the ladies' dressing-room, turned and
fled precipitately in her slippers and without her
outward wraps, rushed home, and that chagrin
and cold brought on a severe illness that
resulted in consumption.  On her death-bed,
unable to forgive the wound to her pride, she
made her daughter promise that, eschewing all
thoughts of love, she would promise her to
marry only a man of such position she would
be able to look down on those who had snubbed
her mother.  Being young, rich and pretty, this
young girl accepted an aged man of very high
rank, refusing one of the finest young men in
Quebec, of whom she was fond, and commenced
a life of unhappiness with a gentleman who in
his dotage made her live almost a recluse in
the country, and dress up and go through the
drill as if he were commanding still.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>His death finally rescued her from such a
life, but by that time her nervous system had
become so thoroughly unhinged, her mind gave
way, and the last I knew of her was her being
sent to the lunatic asylum, having no child or
relative to care for her.  A sad comment on an
ill-placed mother's ambition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the opposite corner of said stone house was
a pretty little residence occupied at one time
and owned by the late Major Temple, adjoining
which was his father-in-law's residence, the late
Hon. Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell.  Both these
houses still stand, but in vain I look for the
pretty lace curtains, and the two parrots on their
stands, calling to you through the bright flowers
in the window of the late Major Temple's
residence.  As an old Quebecer I am ashamed to
say that pretty house has been the one blot on
the whole of Quebec's loveliest street.  It has
been turned into a petty candy shop, a couple
of bottles of sweets, two or three sugar-sticks
and halfpenny cakes, and a notice, "Registry
Office for Servants," replaces the view of the
parrots and flowers.  Were I rich I should purchase
the property myself, and for old times let some
one occupy it who would keep up somewhat its
former appearance.  Such a thing would not have
occurred in Montreal.  The Montrealers have
too much ambition for their city to let it
deteriorate, and consequently property becomes more
valuable every day.  Why, to think Americans
should have been permitted to carry off bodily
the house where Montgomery's body was laid
and are making a fortune out of it, having set it
up as an Indian curiosity shop in some part of
the States.  Why not have done it here?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Strolling on through the beautiful St. Louis
Gate, past the new armory, certainly a credit to
the old city, and past rows of handsome new
houses, we come to a solid looking building with
a golden lion sign.  When I looked at it, I
wondered if it was chosen to beguile the
innocent into the impression that they were
at the old chien d'or.  It does not need that
it has memories enough of its own, for here
lived the late A. Joseph, Esq., and his
amiable wife, one of the most charming of
hostesses, and who gave us any number of
pleasant parties, but almost every house on that
street (then, as now, quite a fashionable one) is
associated with pleasant recollections.  The one
just inside the toll gate on the left was then
occupied by Capt. Charles Campbell, a retired
officer of Her Majesty's 99th, I think, father
of our old friend, A. C., joint Prothonotary of
Quebec.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mr. Le Moine, in his able work, "The
Explorations of Eastern Latitudes," by Jonathan
Old Buck, F. G. S. Q., so graphically depicted
the Plains of Abraham and its surroundings,
I can but touch on old personal memories,
which as they please me in writing, for I live
but in the past, may serve to amuse you, my
readers, in an idle hour.  I will now stop at
Spencer Wood, and visit the pretty home of
our favorite author.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The house at present occupied by Judge
Bosse, Quebec, was fitted up in 1860 for Lord
Monck, Spencer Wood having been burnt down
on 12th March, 1860.  Spencer Wood residence
having been rebuilt and fitted up in accordance
with the requirements of a permanently selected
vice-regal residence, was successively occupied
by the following parties:</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Sir Edmund Head, 1860; Lord Monck,
1861; Sir N. F. Belleau, Lieut.-Governor,
1867; Hon. R. E. Caron, Lieut.-Governor,
afterwards Sir R. E. Caron, 1870; Hon. Luc
Letellier, 1878; Hon. Theodore Robitaille,
1879; Hon. Mr. Masson, 1884; Hon. Auguste
Réal Angers, 1889, who married in April, 1890,
Emelie Le Moine, daughter of the late Alex. Le
Moine, who now resides there, Oct. 15th, 1890.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>You drive through a pretty road, heavily
lined with trees, but through the foliage discern
a neat cottage at the left, frequently occupied
by the pastors of St. Michael's church.  On the
right, facing the grass plots and bedded in trees
stands a very pretty residence, quite spacious
inside, and containing every comfort and
elegance, presided over by a charming
hostess and her daughters.  Mrs. L., the most
amiable of ladies, spares no fatigue in showing
you all that can interest, and there is a
great deal to see at the Grange.  The parlor
windows look on a lawn skirted with various
trees, where many a wild bird makes its
nest, and looking outwards, and listening to
their varied notes, you could fancy yourself in a
deep wood.  From a pretty dining-room you
pass through a passage lined with marble
busts of the ancient heroes of Greece and
Rome, into the grapery, where the heavy
clusters of grapes look too lovely to be plucked.
An aviary adjoins this, and at times the soft
cooing of doves mingles with the other caged
inmates and the notes of the wild birds in the
adjacent shrubbery.  All is so quiet here, you
might fancy yourself miles from civilization.
It is a fitting home for a literary man, and bears
everywhere an impress of elegance and
refinement.  Mr. Le Moine has some very curious
heads of rare animals and numerous trophies
of the chase and rare birds sent by admiring
friends.  The odor of the new-mown hay and the
varied scent of the flowers complete the charm
of this pretty home.  Amongst other curiosities,
Mr. Le Moine has the original key of one of
the city gates, which has been presented to him.
It is a very ponderous looking affair.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>We will take a stroll back, citywards, coming
down the Esplanade, about the year 1850.  We
notice, as we near the Esplanade, the sound of
the band in full force.  The Esplanade benches
are crowded with ladies.  From the windows
of many houses, spectators look on the gay
scene; while lord and lady, cavalier and belle,
pass to and fro to enjoy the military music and
a chat with their acquaintances.  The militia,
in some measure, replace the regular army, but
with a difference: the latter were, as a general
rule, men of wealth, culture, travel, and leisure
with little else to do but make themselves,
agreeable to the ladies, which they did so
successfully as to arouse the ire of the civilians.
Even from the few houses that face the Esplanade
alone, one, at least, and, as in the family of
Sheriff Sewell (now occupied by Mr. Hunt),
no less than three, if not four, were carried off
by English officers; and from houses nearly
adjoining went Miss Panet, Miss Healy, two
Misses Motz, the handsome Miss Joly, Miss
Bradshaw, Miss Maxham; and a few doors
around the corner, on St. Anne street, Miss
Ashworth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Amongst the noted belles living on the
Esplanade were the handsome Burrage ladies
and the Misses Mackenzie, whose father
met his death in a very sad manner.  There
was a house situated on the St. Louis road
called the "H—— House," where (there
being very large rooms to let for picnic use)
were often held evening entertainments.  On
one occasion the bachelors gave us a ball there.
It was a lovely moonlight night, but very cold,
and, wherever there was little snow, glare ice.
Mr. Mackenzie and his daughters drove out in
safety to the door; but, on alighting, he slipped
and broke his leg.  Being a man beyond middle
age, he never quite recovered.  The shock
was, I think, the prime cause of his death.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>C. E. Levy, Esq., occupied the house, former
corner of St. Anne and the Esplanade.  The
first house opposite, on St. Anne street, was then
the residence of Captain, afterwards Admiral
Boxer, and the propinquity was so favorable,
he induced the handsome daughter of Captain
B—— to change her father's home for his.
His widow now owns one of Quebec's most
beautiful and costly residences on the St. Louis
road.  The house now occupied by Sir William
Meredith was, when I was a child, the house of
Judge, after Sir William Stuart.  His daughter,
most kindly I remember, sent me a doll, dressed
in crimson satin, velvet and train, to represent
Her Majesty.  Its gorgeousness is still before
me.  The corner house above that was at one
time occupied by Mrs. White, whose two handsome
daughters married the brothers G——
and another took captive a favorite army doctor.
One, her pretty young niece, if I mistake not,
Miss McG——, afterwards Mrs. B——, lived
with her here.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Some years later one sees the erect, handsome
old gentleman, Town-Major Knight, taking his
daily stroll always arm-in-arm with one of his
sons, as hale and hearty a year or two before
his death as he was almost twenty years before.
One of his daughters still resides in Quebec,
the wife of our old but always young friend,
Henry A——.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It gives me so much pleasure to recall
these old days, to people the streets of my old
birthplace with dead and gone friends, who
come up so vividly before my mental vision,
I could sit for hours and bring them up before
you; but to strangers this would be wearisome,
so I'll only glance at one or two more, and then,
with a few hasty memories of some of our most
eminent Quebec gentlemen, turn from the past
to the present.  I cannot close without speaking
of two gentlemen who occupied such a
prominent place in gay society, Messrs. Angers
and Lelièvre, lawyers, partners and near
neighbors.  We always looked to them for a
succession of most agreeable entertainments.  If I am
not mistaken, at the time they lived on
Haldimand hill, and before they purchased the
St. Louis hotel, it was divided into two houses,—one
occupied by that gay old gentleman, Mr. Burroughs
and his family, one of whose handsome
daughters, Cecil, not long deceased,
married the Hon. Mr. Garneau; the other still
lives, I think, in Paris (Mrs. Kimber).  His son
John, a very quiet looking gentleman, most
unexpectedly carried off our great society belle
at that time, the lovely Leda L., from
numerous competitors, mother of Madame
Masson, wife of the late Governor Masson.
But if I go on to speak of all the pretty
girls of which we could boast at that time,
I should go on for ever, so I will present to
you a slight sketch of some of our most
prominent men.  Of Hon. George Okill Stuart, Sir
James Stuart, and Hon. Henry Black so
much has been written that I will only mention
their names, and give you a slight sketch of
Mr. Faribault, a most genial gentleman, of
particularly courteous manners, very literary, of good
old French family, and universally respected.
He lived in the old house on whose site is built
that now occupied by his only child and
daughter, who married Quebec's famous artist,
Mr. Hamel.  Mr. Hamel had a most particular gift
for catching likenesses, demonstrated when quite
a boy.  He died unfortunately quite young,
leaving a son and daughter, who with their
mother reside in her father's old home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Charles Gethings, son of Captain James
Gethings, an Irish officer of the old 100th
Regiment, was born in Bona Vista, Newfoundland,
and came to this country with his father.  His
first residence was that occupied formerly by
Hon. George Primrose.  Captain Gethings was
stricken with paralysis while mounting guard at
Hope Gate, and died at the fourth house on the
right hand going up towards the Fabrique.  His
son Charles, after being employed a short time
in the Commissariat, then with Gillespie, Moffatt
&amp; Co., Montreal, subsequently in the City Bank
of Quebec, spent many years as manager of the
Quebec Bank, Quebec, receiving to the day of
his death a liberal pension from the Quebec
Bank.  A kind father, a scrupulously upright
man, the family all honor his memory.  He
sleeps in St. Matthew's churchyard vault.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>My young friends, I live so little in the present,
so much in the past, I hardly know the customs
of modern society, but I am not so totally out
of the world as not to be conscious that old-time
hospitalities on that day are quite relegated
to the past, and happily the cake and wine
given once so freely are no longer fashionable,
for I think now with amaze of our ancient
customs, and wonder how, having partaken of the
lavish hospitality of these old days, any of
our beaux could have got home without the aid
of Dickens' traditional wheelbarrow.  As it may
amuse you I will just give you a picture of New
Year's day as kept about forty years ago.  Well,
I cannot state what precise year, but one New
Year's day the courtyard of the English Cathedral
was a mass of glare ice, just like a skating
rink, and no lady could go to service at the
English cathedral without the assistance of a
well-shod beau to help her to keep her
equilibrium, and after service return with me to the
home of one of our city belles.  You will find
the mother of the family in full dress, seated
in a comfortable arm chair, a bright fire
burning in the grate, magazine in hand, to while
away the hour when the ready attendant will
usher in the first visitor.  A couple of young
ladies beside her, in full dress, pink, blue or gray
satin or silk décolleté, a heavy gold chain or
valuable watch visible attached to a handsome
gold watch hook on the side of the dress, a
bouquet holder in one hand, and embroidered
handkerchief and white kid gloves and numerous
bracelets, they sit with all the indifference it is
possible to simulate, till the announcement of
Mr. A, soon followed by B, C, D, and E, till
the room is so crowded only the compliments
of the season can be exchanged before with
a bow one gentleman gives place to another,
and so numerous are the visitors in some
favored houses, perhaps even eighty in a
day, one of the family surreptitiously takes
the names for future recognizance, and woe be
to the unfortunate swain whom forgetfulness or
too much occupation may have prevented from
paying his respects; he will surely be left out
of the list of invites for the next ball.  And yet,
poor unfortunate, he cannot leave the house
without taking from the hand of the fair lady of
the house a glass of wine, and that offer he was
expected to accept perhaps at twenty or thirty
houses.  A year or two later it was considered
bon ton to offer nothing in the parlor, but an
obsequious waiter tendered ale, wines and other
delicacies, catching the departing visitor in a
parlor near the hall door.  This was something
better.  A gentleman could refuse a waiter's
demand—not so easily a lady's.  Still later,
about fifteen years ago, I well remember the
Rev. Mr. Hébert, of Kamouraska, asking as a
personal favor and a mark of respect to himself
that none of his parishioners should offer
temptation to the weak in the form of stimulant to
New Year's visitors, and he very lucidly
expressed himself in these terms: "You say some
of you are advised by your physician to take
wine, well, that is all right, and put your liquor
beside your pills, and as you do not think it
necessary to give physic to all your friends
because the doctor orders it for you, neither do I
think the tonic that may do you good necessary
to sow broadcast to those to whom it may prove a
bitter poison."  This was particularly hard
on a character in the village we had dubbed
Monseigneur because he served a former
Bishop, and being wealthy he piqued himself
on bringing something new for New Year, and
his last purchase had been a valuable liquor
stand.  He was heart-broken.  Being a very pious
man he was deeply chagrined to think he could
not display his new purchase, till he was once
more elevated to the summit of happiness by the
suggestion that raspberry vinegar, lime juice
and lemon syrup would look equally well in his
fine caraffe.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>It must be fifty-two years ago fully when I
first remember the house now occupied by
Mr. O'Hare as a first-class private boarding house.
Its rear faces the Citadel, its front looks into
the barrack yard of the former barracks on
St. Louis street, now occupied by Major Forrest,
Well, this house was then occupied, and I think
owned, by a very dear uncle, the late Charles
Adolphus H.  I say, I think owned, because I
perfectly remember the rocks in rear being
blasted to make a stable and the building of an
extension with vaulting apparatus and so forth
for the young people's recreation, and this
extension adjoined the nursery where presided a
female nurse of wonderful imaginative powers,
who, when the twilight gathered, and we begged
for stories, detailed for our benefit horror after
horror—her only idea of entertainment for young
children.  Well, in the garret of this old house
my dear grand-uncle found a large ledger, very
strongly bound.  On the outer pages were these
words: "I implore whoever finds this volume
to keep it until the year ——, when, if not
reclaimed, then burn it unless he would incur
the curse of a dead man, for by that time all
interested and for whom this book is kept must
be dead."  The leaves were crossed with red
tape, and every here and there sealed with red
sealing wax, but by breaking off a bit of wax
we could read a few words, and though I do
not remember why, we seemed to associate
their meaning with some record of the North-West.
Devoured by curiosity, we young people,
too afraid of the curse to openly destroy the
seals, devised every plan to ascertain the
contents, and one of them was to give the book
to the younger children of the family as a
play-thing, hoping they would break them open and
the contents be exposed; but alas! one day my
dear grand-uncle came upon the scene, fathomed
our project, and put a stop for all time to our
endeavors by putting said ledger in the stove, and
watched it while it burnt.  Was this absolutely
necessary?  Did the most rigid scrupulousness
demand this?  I don't know how others will
answer.  For myself, if I had the book before
me now I would read its contents, and then
judge whether I should divulge its secrets or
not in the interest of the public.  What a field
of conjecture is open here!  This book
contained records of the North-West.  Of what?
Do you remember, my friends, an article that
appeared in the papers very many years ago,
saying that a voyageur had discovered
somewhere in the far north an old white-haired
gentleman, the Rev. Ebenezer Williams, who
claimed to be the son of the unfortunate
Dauphin, son of the decapitated Louis XVI.,
and whose devoted followers had rescued from
prison and substituted a pauper, and at great
personal risk brought the unfortunate boy to
America and placed him for safe keeping with
an Indian tribe, and leaving documents to
prove his identity should there ever appear a
chance of his claiming the throne.  But as years
rolled on, and no prospect of his being recalled
to the throne, and his protectors being dead,
he had been educated as a clergyman and
served as missionary till his death.  In fact, it
was only when on his deathbed these facts were
discovered.  Had this book—a very closely
written volume—anything to do with him?
God only knows!</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Our ancestors must have been very honest in
rural parts, and had unlimited faith in each
other's integrity, judging by the early post offices.
The first one I remember was that of Murray
Bay, when on the arrival of the bag its
contents were dumped on the floor and every one
picked out the letters for themselves and friends,
and enacted the part of voluntary carriers for
their friends, and very curious were the articles
then transmitted through the post office, the
mail bags then doing the present express
service.  A relative told me that he was
somewhere in the Gaspé district when the carrier
arrived with the bags he had carried a long
distance on his back, and using rather hard
language at the unwonted weight of the bag,
and curious to see what was the cause of this
extraordinary weighty mail, when lo! out
tumbled two immense wild geese, sent as a
present by the Hon. W. H. to a friend.  Fancy
the dénouement and the wrath of the old
Scotchman, who had borne the weight on a long
tramp through a pathway in the forest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One of the most curious experiences I ever had
occurred about ten years ago, when I went with
my family to a rural summer resort.  We were
several miles from the post office, and had very
steep hills to climb on every side, so I wished to
kill two birds with one stone, and decided to go
to the post office after church service.  I did so,
and inquired for a registered letter I expected.
After a few minutes inquiry the maitre de poste
said: "Yes, there is a registered letter for you,
but I can't find it, but it is all right, it is in the
book."  "Well," I said, as the assistant was
absent and might possibly have said letter in
charge, "I'll call back after afternoon service."  I
did so, but again the letter could not be found.
"You'll probably be passing in a week or so,
won't you call in then, by that time I have no
doubt we'll have it for you."  "But," I said, "that
won't do.  I am a stranger here and need the
money."  "Ah! madame" (they were French
Canadians), "we are very sorry to inconvenience
you, and if you will say how much you need
will be happy to advance you the cash, as by
our books you are entitled to some."  I could
not feel angry with these simple people, they
were evidently so honest and true.  Yet, as I
wanted my letter, with home news, as well as
the cash, I proposed that we should make a
search in the post office, which was also a shop
of general merchandise.  So, after looking
through box after box, some suggested looking
in the cellar, as an ill-fitting trap door with wide
cracks was directly under the official desk.  The
cellar, however, did not contain the missing
document, and I was almost in despair of
recovering for some time my lost property, when
a happy inspiration came to me, and I inquired
if they sold envelopes.  "Ah! oui, madame,"
they did, and among the envelopes ready to be
sold at about a cent a piece was my letter
containing fifty dollars cash, which, minus my
persistence, might have found its way into the
pocket of some honest or dishonest purchaser.
But all is well that ends well, and I parted from
my post office friends with expressions of
mutual regard, and fearing to do them harm,
believing so fully in their integrity, I never
spoke of the matter; but when, some years later,
I heard the Post Office Inspector had made
radical changes, I thought it was beneficial to
the general public.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>In the year ——, the late lamented Lieut. Fayrer,
ordinance officer, came to Quebec on a
tour of inspection as to supplies needed
(accompanied by his wife, Lizzie Henshawe, a cousin).
He asked us if we would like to accompany
him through the underground passages of the
Citadel, very rarely open to visitors.  We
gratefully accepted the offer, and so well guarded
was the secrecy of these premises, it was with
the utmost astonishment the soldiers present
heard that underneath their Citadel were miles
of underground passages for transfer in case of
siege, large rooms for the refuge of women and
children, and places for the safe depositing of
treasure.  We accompanied him, and I remember
going down stairs intersected with heavy
iron doors and through long passages with only
outlets for muskets to give light, then into
large damp underground chambers for a safe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I cannot tell the length we went through of
dark passage, but it was some considerable
distance, and the rooms are quite large, I
suppose capable of each holding fifty people.  I
have heard it said (but can't vouch for the truth),
that these passages have an outlet on the
St. Lawrence at one end, and the Martello towers
at the other.  I have no doubt such is the case.
The underground passages are bombproof, and
no sound can be heard from them.  A soldier
forgotten there once gave himself up to die,
until he remembered he might be missed at roll
call.  Such was the case, and his life thus
saved.  The passages are underneath the
Citadel at Cape Diamond, so called because at one
time great quantities of an inferior diamond
were found there.  I remember when the Cape
quite shone with them, and many old people
have handsome jewellery made from these gems.
There is one street of houses opposite the Cape
about fifty-five years ago occupied by the following
parties: the late Chas. Gethings, the late
Col. Dyde, John Carleton Fisher, William Patton
and Col. Gore, father of the present Countess
of Errol.  A small house on the off side,
occupied by a waiter, is the spot where is the
present High School of Quebec.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Ireland, so prominent at the present time,
especially appeals to favorable remembrance of
all her true people, and it may prove interesting
to many of my readers to hear something of
the first St. Patrick's Society ever formed in
Quebec.  I therefore copy for public benefit the
very interesting account of its first doings, given
me by an old friend:—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"In the year 1836 a few Irish gentlemen met
in a small house in the Upper Town market
place to form a St. Patrick's Society without
reference to church or creed, but merely for the
purpose of rendering assistance to any of their
countrymen who might be requiring help or
advice.  Those gentlemen present on that
occasion were as follows:—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Hon. Dominick Daly, then Secretary of
the Province.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Hon. George Pemberton, merchant.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Hon. Mr. Cochrane, brother-in-law to Bishop Mountain.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Sir Henry Caldwell, Baronet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Geo. Holmes Parke, Esq., merchant.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Charles Gethings, Esq., of the Bank, Quebec.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Edward Bowen, Esq., son of Judge Bowen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Edward Ryan, Esq., merchant, and Mr. O'Meara, Custom House.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"These gentlemen formed the St. Patrick's
Society, and the subscription was to be five
shillings each, annually.  They also decided to have
an annual dinner every anniversary.  The
first president was the Hon. D. Daly, and their
first dinner was in a building where now stands
the Russell House.  The subscription to the
dinner was to be six dollars, to make the
meeting as select as possible, and to be paid out of
the subscribers' own pockets without reference
to the annual subscription.  The next president
was the Hon. George Pemberton, and that
dinner took place in the Albion Hotel in Palace
street.  The third president was Sir H. Caldwell;
they dined in the same building, the
Albion.  The fourth president was George
Holmes Parke, Esq., who was annually elected
president for the succeeding fourteen years in
succession, and the dinners took place principally
in the old chateau.  To the anniversary
dinners the presidents of St. George, St. Andrew
and St. John the Baptist were invited as guests,
as was also the heads of all military and civil
departments.  On one occasion in the old chateau,
when over two hundred and fifty guests sat down
to dinner, it looked well to see Geo. Holmes
Parke, Esq., with the president of St. George
on one arm, and the presidents of St. Andrew
and St. John the Baptist on the other, walking
up the long room to the head of the dinner
table.  There were a large number of subscribers
to the Society, and the consequence was,
although the subscription was small, it was
enabled to do a multitude of good.  The
Society for many years got on admirably until
other branches were formed, and then Mr. Parke
did not take the same interest as he had
formerly done.  Notwithstanding, there never
was an anniversary dinner given afterwards but
Mr. Parke was invited to it as a guest, and given
one of the most prominent seats at the table.
Charles Gethings, Esq., I believe, followed
Mr. Parke as president, and after him others whose
names I have not ascertained.  Of all the
gentlemen that met to form the Society, Mr. Parke is
the only one living.  In 1840 Mr. Parke bought
a large tract of land on the River St. Charles, a
short distance from the Dorchester Toll Bridge,
on which he had built a splendid mansion, and
ornamented it with thousands of forest trees
and circular avenues, iron entrance gates, stone
pillars, etc., also beautiful quickset hedges on
each side of the avenues kept neatly trimmed.
In this house, which he called "Ringfield," he
has lived for the last fifty years, and is still living
in it.  There is a splendid view from Ringfield.
From St. Foy's church to St. Peter street in
Lower Town can be seen almost every house in
Upper Town, St. Roch and St. Sauveur.
Down the River St. Lawrence can be seen nine
miles, and from the hall door, before the trees
grew up, could be counted fourteen parish
churches, apart from the city or suburbs.
Mr. Parke came to Canada in 1830, and is now in
his eighty-fourth year.  During his business
career he did a large business, and in the
course of twenty-five years he had built for
himself seventy-six large ships by different
ship builders, which cost and was paid for out
of his office over three million of dollars, apart
from his other business."  This gentlemen is
father of the present popular physician,
Dr. Parke.  Mr. Lemoine in his "Tourist's Note
Book" says: "A very remarkable vestige of
French domination exists behind the villa of
Mr. Parke, a circular field house, hence the name
Ringfield, covering about twelve acres, with an
earthwork once about twenty feet high to
the east, to shield its inmates from the shot of
Wolfe's fleet lying at the entrance of the
St. Charles below Quebec."</span></p>

<br />ONE TIME A RESIDENCE OF
<br />SIR E. R. CARON.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Sillery Church, beautifully situated above
Sillery Cove (one of the best-known lumber
coves near Quebec), has for its parishioners
many families of note, foremost amongst whom
were the Sharples family, well known for their
Catholic piety and their active benevolence.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the time I first knew Sillery Church, its
pastor was the Rev. George Drolet, a very
fervent, energetic priest, who I fear lost his
health in part from over zeal in the discharge of
his arduous duties.  His people being mixed
English and French, I have known him go through
the ritual of two masses, preach two sermons
one in French and one in English (fasting)
though frequently warned against such over-exertion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was stricken with paralysis some years
ago, and though comparatively a young man,
is quite debarred now from all church services.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He exercised considerable influence amongst
his parishioners, many of them being very
difficult to deal with—a floating population
of sailors; but his genial manner and tact
carried him through many difficulties.  I
cannot give a better illustration of that same tact
than by narrating a fact that occurred full
thirty years ago.  At the time of the great
</span><em class="italics">Corrigan Murder</em><span> (as it was called)—the
outcome of a fight between Orangemen and
R. C. Irishmen—the feud ran so high, the
Bishop of Quebec, seeing how impossible it
would be for an Irish priest to abstain from
being drawn into the vortex of party strife,
decided on sending a French-Canadian
priest, who would have no national feeling in
the matter.  The matter was discussed, but
it was supposed to be such a post of danger,
even for a priest, the Bishop decided he would
ask for a volunteer instead of issuing a
command to one of his clergy.  All eyes turned
to the Rev. Mr. Drolet as </span><em class="italics">the one</em><span> suited; he
had been junior priest in St. Patrick's Church
in Quebec, was thoroughly acquainted with
the character of the Irish people, and much
beloved by them.  He offered his services,
which were at once accepted; but some of
his confrères felt badly over the matter and
remonstrated: "You must remember, my
dear sir, that you have a mother and sisters
dependent on you for a home, and you hold
your life in your hand, if you go to ——
in the present state of feeling, as the Irish
say they will not have a French-Canadian
priest."  "I am not afraid," was the Rev. Mr. D.'s
rejoinder; he went, to find the Presbytery
closed, the Parish Church nailed up, and a
very threatening crowd assembled.  He could
do nothing that day, so went to a neighboring
parish to say his morning mass.  The next day
the same scene.  Undaunted he began to talk,
said he always thought an Irishman liked fair
play, and thought he might ask for a few
minutes hearing—he, one man against hundreds.
"Oh! yes," they said, ashamed.  "We'll
let you talk, but remember we don't want to
insult your reverence, but we won't have a
French-Canadian over us."  "Well, answer me
one question, I like to know to whom I am
talking: what is your name, and in what part
of Ireland were you born?"  "Oh, sir, I was
not born in Ireland, but my grandfather and
grandmother came from the Old country."  "And
you? and you?"  The same answer, not
one perhaps in forty were born in Ireland, all
really by birth Canadians, and Mr. D. said,
"You say you won't have me because I am a
French-Canadian, my name is so, but, as my
grandmother was Irish, I consider myself as
Irish as any of you."  His wit carried the day.
He resided there for many years, and was so well
liked that between thirty and forty of his
parishioners accompanied him to do him
honor, when he was given the pastorate of
St. Michel, and I shall never forget the sight
of a crowded steamboat, half of the people in
tears as they went to see him off, and land him
at Sillery, to which he had been promoted—the
most desirable rectorship, I fancy, in the
R. C. gift, near Quebec; but which he was
to enjoy only a few years.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>About thirty years ago, there arrived fresh
from college a newly-ordained clergyman of
the Church of England.  So youthful looking,
so mild in character, it appeared at first as if
he would hardly yet be fitted for the onerous
position of pastor, but he was appointed.
Family influence and money soon caused
St. Matthew's to be most largely patronized,
also free seats.  In the meantime our young
clergyman pursued his unobtrusive way.  Daily
he might be seen in the poorest and least
frequented streets of the city, driving a little
waggonette, evidently constructed to order from
its capacity for holding comforts for his poor
people.  A thoroughly earnest, fervently pious
man, our young clergyman, before many years,
displayed his innate force of character, acquired
great influence, and we know him now as
Charles Hamilton, Bishop of Ontario.</span></p>

daughter, Mrs. Watt, I think still survive!  This
pleasant home was burnt down, the family having
hardly time to escape, and many cherished and
valuable mementoes of the past perished with
it.  It was purchased by James Gibb, Esq., as
a homestead, and so occupied for many years;
and who in the flush of enjoyment at the many
pleasant entertainments given by the Gibb
family would have foreseen the day when many
of those dancing and promenading through
those beautiful grounds would be treading over
perhaps the very spot may be their own resting
place in the quiet grave.  Such is life.  This
cemetery, now of great beauty from its natural
characteristics, is about two miles from Quebec.</span></p>

young son of Sir Edmund Head, who was accidentally
drowned in the St. Lawrence river, and
buried here in Mr. Price's lot.  The Price family
had long occupied a high position in Quebec
society, and been intimate with the families of
several of the governors.  I see they had the
honor of a visit from the Prince on his late trip
to Quebec, who lunched with them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>I will attempt no further description of old
Quebec, Mr. Le Moine has too thoroughly exhausted

of people and incidents illustrative of the
to me good old times.  Perhaps the beauty of the
prospective is enhanced by the distance, but to
those who have passed the meridian of life the
past must ever be dearer than the present, for it
alone is peopled with so many of the loved we
look for in vain now.  So many of my once
dear associates have gone on before me, I
often ponder on what must be the feelings of
one living to a hundred years, who stands
totally alone without one he has known in his
earlier days to greet him.</span></p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works

public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
